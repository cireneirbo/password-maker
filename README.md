# password-maker
A website that creates a strong password for the user based on several user inputs.

Options include:
Length of password
Lowercase and numbers
Uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and 10 common unique characters from number bar.

Doesn't require anything to be installed. Simply clone and open up the index file in your browser, or follow the link provided to create passwords.

The site does not store the passwords anywhere (which is verifiable by studying the code) and the screen can be cleared by refreshing the page.

Contact me with any questions or concerns.
